This a from to specify the requirements needed or required for a software development project

Requirement Analysis is the disciplined process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and restraints of all stakeholders for a proposed system or product.

Requirement Gathering - This consists of doing varoius activites such as surveys and interviews of stakeholders to gather information about about the system expectations.
Requirement Elicitation - This entails condcting various brainstrorming actvities and building prototypes to figure out product requirements.
Requirement Documentation - Turning the result the key funcitonalites into a record which can be referenced 
Requirement Analysis and Modeling - Ensuring the key requiremnts are attainable and are complete
Requirement Validation. - Confirming that the requiremnts gathered reflect stakeholders needs.

Functional requirements - these are things which describe what the program should be able to do eg user registration
Non-functional requirements - These describe how the program should perform eg the program should be able to load up within 2 seconds
